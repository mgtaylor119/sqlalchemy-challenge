# sqlalchemy-challenge

Using Jupyter Notebook I performed a precipitaton and station analysis. Through this analysis, the below graphs were created:

Precipitation Graph:  
![precipitation](https://github.com/mgtaylor119/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/Images/precipitation_graph.png?raw=true)

Precipitation Summary Statistics:  
![summary stats](https://github.com/mgtaylor119/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/Images/precipitation_summary.png?raw=true)

Stations Graph:  
![stations]

Once the analysis was done, the API was created, with the below routes:
